                            <p>Through residential education, leadership opportunities on campus, internships and community service, students add critical "outside of the classroom" learning to their overall educational experience.</p>
                            <p>The King Oak academic experience blends the liberal arts and sciences with professional experience to prepare students for careers and graduate studies. Students work closely with the faculty and staff who become their mentors, and emerge as active learners and confident scholars, artists, writers, scientists, critical thinkers and community leaders.</p>

                            <h2> Active Roles</h2>
                            <p>King Oak students take an active role in designing their own education from their very first semester, starting by choosing a theme-based, interdisciplinary First-Year Symposium. The symposium, which is the foundation of the college's Liberal Education Program, allows a group of first-year students to explore the topic with a faculty member before heading in their chosen academic directions. At the same time, students develop the writing, reading and thinking skills necessary for success in college and beyond.</p>
                            <p>Our Liberal Education Program allows students to discover and develop their talents across academic disciplines, and to record their progress and accomplishments in electronic portfolios. They expand their academic horizons and serve their communities by doing required work in these areas:</p>

                            First-Year Symposium Courses: Students discover the connectedness of knowledge and work collaboratively.

                            Exploration Courses: Students broaden their knowledge in the arts and sciences disciplines.
<br />
                            Internships: Nearly every King Oak student completes some form of professional preparation experience, including internships, clinical internships, student teaching, and service-learning.

                            The Capstone: In their senior year, students use their accumulated knowledge in a culminating project.</p>

Because we are a mighty force to be reconed with at this college as an administrative body. We love your parents and their money. We are staunch Calvinists and believe that priviledge and success comes not from self-exploration and discovery, but from denial of pleasure and wearing white, constricting undergarments. We like lumberjacks and cheese. That is about it. Oh, and sheep. We like sheep. <br />But don't tell the constable. They belong to him.</p>
